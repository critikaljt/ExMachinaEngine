A 3D Game Engine, Designed for old-school shooters

**We Need Help!**
If you are decently experienced in Java programming, we could use you!
--We currently need help with: The "engine_classconverter"
  Why? Currently the "jarclassconverter.bat" doesn't work properly, we put in a file, namely the App.java to convert it after making modifications, but it needs the other classes and libraries, what we did was put the files in a "classpath" directory but it still says the engine.GameObject package doesn't exist, and so on with other libraries/classes that are required, if you know a fix, please contact at: critikal.jt@gmail.com
--We also need help with: Documentation
--We also need help with: Post Processing
