**QUICK START GUIDE**
**A batch file to make everything much easier is coming soon**
Put the ExMachinaEngine folder somewhere on your computer
Click the MakeProject.bat file on your computer, then follow the steps
Once the MakeProject.bat file says "Done!" Exit the installer

Go into the engineclassconverter from your project, and edit the java files, 
click the jarclassconvert, which converts all the java files to class files

Drag the class file into the source and replace it
E.G. engineclassconverter --> edit App.java, GameObject.java, click jarclassconvert, copy App.class, GameObject.class
Goto enginetemplate or engine folder, copy files to corrosponding directory, App.class(Copied) --> main\App.class - replace

Yes it's complicated, but it's being worked on!
